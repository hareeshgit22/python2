Errors detected during execution are called exceptions.
An exception is a python object that represents an error.
Example:
try:
	x = input("enter the first number:")
	y = input("enter the second number:"	)
	ret = x/y
	print("result = ",ret)
exceptZeroDivisionError:
	print("Divide by zero exception happened")
